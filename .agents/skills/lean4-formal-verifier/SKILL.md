name: lean4-formal-verifier
description: Formalize mathematical specifications in this Lean project, verify modules and axiom dependencies with the local CLI, integrate reviewed suites, and draft English knowledge cards.
---

Use the project root containing `tools/verifier_skill.py`. Read
`knowledge/CONTRIBUTING.en.md` and the relevant section's existing cards before
adding a module. The CLI operates on trusted local Lean projects; it is not a
sandbox for hostile Lean metaprograms or Lake configuration.

## Specification to checked result

Translate the user's specification into explicit types, definitions, hypotheses,
and conclusions. Show the correspondence between the requested property and the
Lean statement. A defined predicate is not a proved transition invariant.
Preserve distinctions between a scalar model, a protocol, and its implementation.

Use `python3 tools/verifier_skill.py verify Verification/Module.lean` after
writing code. A successful report requires strict compilation, a Lake build against current sources,
and a transitive axiom audit of all declarations in imported Verification modules.
`python3 tools/verifier_skill.py audit Verification/Module.lean` also rebuilds
and verifies before auditing, so stale artifacts cannot certify changed source.
Read the report's `ok`, `audit`, source hashes and errors, not just process output.
Allowed axioms are `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`. No `sorry`, `admit`,
custom axioms or native-decide shortcuts. Do not disable checks to make a report pass.

`scaffold` can attempt a small explicit Lean proposition using `omega`, `ring`,
or `nlinarith`. It does not translate prose, generate arbitrary data models, or
certify that a proposition matches the user's intent. On failure, review and
improve the proof; never replace the intended conclusion with `True` or assume it.

## Verification scope and resource use

During proof development, verify the changed module and run its targeted live
regressions. `verify` already includes the transitive axiom audit: do not follow a
successful `verify` with `audit` for the same unchanged inputs. `audit` is an
alternative entry point, not an independent second auditor. `card` also verifies;
use it when a generated draft is needed, not as another routine check.

Keep Lake's incremental cache during development. Do not delete `.lake/build` or
request clean rebuilds on every edit. Beta qualification below has a separate
clean-project requirement. Checking one module follows its imports, not its reverse
dependents: when changing an existing API, also build affected importing modules
and run their relevant regressions. Expand the scope if dependencies are unclear.
Documentation-only edits need documentation/catalog checks, not Lean rechecking.

Follow [VERSIONING.md](../../../VERSIONING.md): alpha is global system change;
beta is a full checkpoint; gamma is a catalog direction; delta is a named batch
(possibly one module); epsilon is a module; zeta is an internal correction.
Lower levels require an explicit parent. Historical tags retain their old meaning.
Use `tools/verification_plan.py` to include imported and reverse dependencies.
Escalate cross-direction changes and trust/toolchain changes as the policy requires.

For beta run `tools/release_evidence.py run-beta` with an external evidence directory
and the pinned independent auditor. This runs every proof, all live tests, registry
integration, registered conformance checks and catalog checks. Its initial build
invalidates only project artifacts; mount external dependency caches read-only.
The clean-build receipt must cover every planned project module and CLI target;
one or several fresh modules are insufficient. Do not rebuild Mathlib per tree.
Do not describe registered conformance coverage as independent semantic review of
all modules. Consult [the hierarchy guide](../../../docs/verification-hierarchy.en.md)
and [qutrit contract](../../../docs/qutrit-conformance.en.md) for those workflows.

Keep requirements separate from candidate proofs. Never regenerate a normative
specification or its pins merely to make a candidate pass. Review changes to them
as specification changes. Classify tests as API applications, independent expected
values, counterexamples, mutation rejection or concrete satisfiability witnesses.

Develop in isolated trees; integrate batches sequentially on current main. Reject
stale expected parents, rerun invalidated checks, and never force-push a divergent
main. Check exact committed bytes against accepted evidence before publishing.
Respect authorization already given by the user; do not add redundant approvals.

Record the last full-validation commit and subsequent scoped evidence. Reuse
results only for their recorded scope and unchanged source, configuration,
toolchain and dependencies; private-tree evidence does not certify a different
public tree. After changes rerun affected checks for the final integrated code.
Report cached build targets separately from freshly compiled modules and never
report a targeted run as a fresh whole-library check. Existing CLI commands do
not automatically select reverse dependents or enforce this release policy.

## Integration and cards

`integrate MODULE SUITE` returns a diff. `--apply` updates the recipe-selected
parent module and the central/root imports. Existing domain packages live in
`Verification.MasterSuiteComponents`; recipes select it with `parent_module`.
It uses an explicit recipe in `tools/integration_targets.json`, then verifies and
builds; failure restores those source files. Add a reviewed recipe for a new
suite rather than guessing universes or overwriting the registry. Preserve inherited
fields, integral results and existing public APIs. Source rollback does not
restore build caches; rebuild before using them after failure.

`card MODULE` returns a English draft after verification. Read theorem types,
add the actual assumptions and limitations, then save it in the appropriate
knowledge section. Do not overwrite an existing reviewed card with the generic
draft. Update catalog imports, section navigation and source-line links, and run
`python3 scripts/check_knowledge.py`. Keep novelty `not-assessed` absent a documented
comparison with earlier proofs/formalizations.

Use `verify-all` for the complete project audit and module checks. Counts refer
to declarations, not independent theorems. Report actual checks and unresolved
scope. Publication, licensing and public releases are separate from verification.

For CLI examples, report semantics, API calls and external-assistant connection,
read [the tool guide](../../../docs/verifier-skill.en.md) in this repository.
