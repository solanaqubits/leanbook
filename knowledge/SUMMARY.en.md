# Results and practical value

[Knowledge base](README.md)

This project collects reusable, machine-checked components and the tooling needed
to keep their proofs, assumptions, and documentation connected. The current catalog contains 400 modules across twelve sections, with 404 library
Lean files including nested support sources and the root. See the
[validation record](VERIFICATION.en.md) for the distinct historical checkpoints
and scoped integration evidence.

## What has been achieved

- Explicit definitions and theorem statements replace informal claims with checkable obligations.
- Algebraic and finite results cover coefficient bounds, matrix identities, commitment equations, reserve and balance invariants, and quorum intersections.
- A central theorem collects selected guarantees while preserving their hypotheses.
- A CLI supports strict compilation, dependency auditing, controlled integration, and draft knowledge cards.
- English cards record what each model covers and what remains unformalized.

## Why it is useful

The components can support larger proofs without repeating the same arithmetic or
algebra. They make assumptions visible, expose mistakes in proposed arguments,
and provide a reproducible way to detect regressions. Their value is the precise,
checked statements and reusable development process.

For example, the Collatz branch coefficients have arithmetic mean 639/512 > 1,
while a related geometric product is below one. Keeping those distinct prevents
an invalid global-contraction inference. The Pedersen module checks real scalar
identities while explicitly leaving probabilistic hiding and computational binding
outside its scope. The operational Raft module proves election safety from reachable message-passing
states. The network-induction module now derives global Log Matching and historical entry/message provenance from those transitions. The complete-bridge module derives Leader Completeness and retention of prefixes already held by a replica from actual commit events in the unchanged operational automaton; it does not assume abstract VoterEvolution.

## Novelty and remaining work

Formalizing a known identity is different from discovering a new theorem.
First-formalization claims also require comparison with existing libraries and
literature. No such priority claim is established here.

The next substantive steps are stronger models, links between abstractions and
implementations, documented comparisons with prior formalizations, and integration
with standard reusable Mathlib abstractions where appropriate. Compilation alone
does not close those gaps or establish production protocol security.


## Finite-field batch counting and conditional noise optimization

`CryptoSchnorrBatchVerification` proves exact accepting counts and rational
fractions for a fixed nonzero discrepancy over `ZMod q`, with prime `q`.
There are `q^(n-1)` accepting vectors out of `q^n`, giving `1/q`;
full Cartesian products give `(1/q)^k` for repeated checks. Coefficients include
zero. The interpretation as independent uniform sampling does not formalize a
sampler or an adversarial security game. EUF-CMA, CSPRNG correctness, and BIP340
coefficient derivation are not established.

`QuantumStandardQuantumLimit` proves that `A/I + B*I`, for positive parameters,
has attained minimum `2*sqrt(A*B)` and unique optimizer `sqrt(A/B)`, where the
contributions balance. SQL-shaped variance and square-root bounds require the
explicit calibration `(hbar/(2*m*omega_m))^2 ≤ A*B`. Calibration and omission of
noise correlations are external model assumptions. Quantum commutators,
spectral densities, Langevin dynamics, and physical detector performance are
not formalized.


## Hundred-import milestone

Release v0.5.0 adds threshold time envelopes, elementary transcript forking,
a real beam-splitter model with a finite two-boson lift, and the acyclic milestone
registry. The registry assembles selected propositions without strengthening their
hypotheses. See the [verification record](VERIFICATION.en.md) for scope and counts.


The v0.5.1 numeric extension adds three registry suites in five source files.
That release had 103 direct imports and 139 Lean files. Those results certify
mathematical rounding and conditional root enclosures; composition with supplied
digest/parser functions does not verify SHA-256, JSON, Python or source authenticity.
See the [numeric section](12_numeric_certificates/README.md).

Release v0.5.2 adds the affine SQL gap bounds, exact-zero criterion and real rounding composition, bringing the registry to 104 imports and 140 Lean files. Rationalization and exact cell-boundary comparison/search are separate obligations.

Release v0.5.3 adds operational two-process Chandy–Lamport snapshot safety: saved-cut consistency and exact completed-channel contents. That release has 105 direct imports and 141 Lean files. Partial recording is distinct from completed channel contents; liveness and fault tolerance are not claimed.

Release v0.5.4 adds exact two-bit QPE, derived controlled phase kickback and inverse Fourier cancellation. That release had 106 direct imports and 142 Lean files. The exact normalized eigenstate is an input promise; approximate QPE and hardware are not certified.

Release v0.5.5 adds [multiple-target Grover dynamics](03_quantum_physics_and_optics/QuantumGroverMultipleTargets.md) on four real coordinates, including every target subset and iteration count, legacy compatibility and both rank-one reflection counterexamples. That release had 107 direct imports and 143 Lean files.

[General Deutsch–Jozsa](03_quantum_physics_and_optics/QuantumDeutschJozsaGeneral.md) adds an explicit real Hadamard/XOR circuit for any finite n, preserving the old one-bit formulas. The classifier requires the constant-or-balanced promise; quantum hardware and oracle construction costs are not certified.

Release v0.5.6 adds the general Deutsch–Jozsa Hadamard and XOR-ancilla circuit with promise separation, n=0 and one-qubit compatibility. That release had 108 direct imports and 144 Lean files.

Release v0.5.7 adds [Raft commit application](09_distributed_systems/DistributedRaftCommitApplication.md): operational commit-index provenance and ordered local application. Cross-node folds require full-entry prefix equality; no new global State Machine Safety theorem is claimed. That release had 109 direct imports and 147 Lean files.

[Operational 2PC timeouts](09_distributed_systems/DistributedTwoPhaseCommitTimeout.md) adds reachable-state agreement, pre-vote abort safety and indistinguishable prepared histories. Blocking is characterized relative to a stopped coordinator and both participants prepared; a queued decision enables delivery without guaranteeing eventual progress.

Release v0.5.8 contains 110 direct imports and 148 Lean files; see the [release report](../docs/release-v0.5.8.en.md).

[DistributedThreePhaseCommit](09_distributed_systems/DistributedThreePhaseCommit.md): two-participant operational safety, finite completion paths and completion under concrete action fairness after an accurate stable fenced view. Election and fencing are external contracts.

Release v0.5.9 contains 111 direct imports and 151 Lean files; see the [release report](../docs/release-v0.5.9.en.md).

Release v0.5.10 adds static-epoch AND probe soundness, conditional delivery progress and a counterexample to naive dynamic edge checking. See the [release report](../docs/release-v0.5.10.en.md).

[Quantum v4.37–v4.39 integration](../docs/quantum-integration-v437-v439.md): noisy trees, chronological schedules and the certified noisy witness.
