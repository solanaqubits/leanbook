# MasterSuite

[Section](README.md) · [Lean source](../../Verification/MasterSuite.lean)

## Verified result

Eleven existing domain suites, four numerical certificate suites, and the historical milestone aggregate; the current registry has 192 direct imports. The registry does not contain every declaration in the project. The Raft package includes reachable-state election safety, global Log Matching, operational Leader Completeness for actual commit events, and preservation of committed prefixes. The new bridge proves the operational conclusion directly; it does not instantiate the earlier whole-log VoterEvolution abstraction.

## Assumptions and scope

Axiom auditing checks dependencies of formal declarations, not whether the model faithfully represents its intended application. Allowed standard axioms are not custom assumptions.

The Lean theorem types are authoritative for exact quantifiers and hypotheses.
Scientific priority and first-formalization claims have not been established.

## Verification

See the [validation record](../VERIFICATION.en.md) for the audited source snapshot.

`CryptoFullSuite.feldman_vss` includes scalar consistency and reconstruction against fixed coefficient commitments; no cryptographic secrecy is claimed.

`PhotonicsInterposerFullSuite.chip_layout` adds translation invariance and exact rational bounds checking. The separate `chip_placement_certificate` field certifies the exact stored 256-node placement. External digest binding remains outside the Lean proof.

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.optomechanical_coupling` adds normalized scalar energy, force derivatives, dispersion, and a prescribed damping model. Full quantum dynamics and cooling are not proved.

`CryptoFullSuite.musig2_aggregation` includes scalar two-nonce signature completeness and a restricted cancellation barrier. Hash-based rogue-key resistance and the BIP 327 protocol are not proved.

`PhotonicsInterposerFullSuite.mithraic_collapse` includes scalar visibility bounds, exact zero/unit contrast criteria, fixed-maximum monotonicity and threshold validity. Quantum decoherence and automatic physical dump-port routing are not proved.

`CryptoFullSuite.schnorr_batch` includes exact prime-field acceptance counts and fractions 1/q and (1/q)^k for fixed nonzero residuals under uniform independent coefficient sampling. These are finite counting ratios, not an implemented random sampler or a security theorem for Schnorr signatures.

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.standard_quantum_limit` proves the exact minimum and unique positive optimizer of A/I + B*I, balanced contributions, and a conditional standard-deviation bound. Calibration and omission of cross correlations are external modeling assumptions; quantum uncertainty and spectral detector dynamics are not derived.

`DistributedSystemsFullSuite.marzullo_algorithm` proves true-time inclusion in the smallest closed envelope of points meeting a fixed overlap threshold. The fault model assumes at least n-f sources contain the truth; f<n suffices for envelope inclusion, while n-f>f yields a shared honest-source witness. The envelope can contain unsupported gaps. A formal counterexample refutes true-time localization by maximum overlap. No sorted event sweep, RFC5905 equivalence, clock dynamics or NTP implementation is verified.

`CryptoFullSuite.forking_lemma` proves the elementary finite uniform matrix bound ε(ε−1/q) ≤ pFork, fork existence above 1/q, and scalar witness extraction with a fixed row commitment and injective challenge encoding. Challenges are independent uniform draws with replacement, and equal draws count as failure. Exact ratios of finite counts are formalized; an adaptive random-oracle execution, the general multi-query Bellare–Neven forking lemma, runtime guarantees, and cryptographic security are not proved.

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.beam_splitter` proves a real orthogonal two-mode transformation, its normalized finite three-coordinate two-boson lift, polynomial substitution, norm preservation and ideal HOM suppression for |1,1⟩ exactly at balanced power splitting. Indistinguishability and the Born-rule interpretation are modeling assumptions. No complex reflection phase, full Fock space, distinguishability, temporal dip profile, detector model, hardware validation or formal equivalence with existing MZI modules is claimed.

`MasterHundredRegistry.master_hundred_registry_verified` aggregates eleven existing packages and five redundant recent-component projections. Shared declarations moved unchanged to `MasterSuiteComponents` in their original namespace. `MasterSuite` imports the milestone and retains the 99 earlier direct imports, giving 100 unique direct imports without a cycle. This organizational milestone preserves hypotheses and introduces no new domain theorem or all-declarations coverage claim. The 134 source files comprise 130 subject files and four registry/audit support files. These are historical v0.5.0 metrics. Current extensions are described in the validation record.

The central registry now has 174 direct imports and the separate `rounding_certificates`, `sql_intervals`, `digest_bridge` and `sql_gap_bounds` fields. The historical MasterHundredRegistry remains unchanged. See [NumericRoundingCertificates](../12_numeric_certificates/NumericRoundingCertificates.md).

[Verification.NumericSQLGapBounds](../../Verification/NumericSQLGapBounds.lean) — affine gap bounds, exact zero and real rounding composition.

`DistributedSystemsFullSuite.chandy_lamport` derives consistency of saved local cuts and exact completed-channel contents from a two-process FIFO transition system. Partial transit recording has a separate theorem; fairness and termination are not proved.

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.phase_estimation` derives exact two-bit phase recovery from controlled U/U², a supplied normalized eigenstate and inverse Fourier cancellation. Approximate phases and physical hardware are outside scope.

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.grover_multiple_targets` adds exact N=4 subset dynamics, norm preservation, the proper-subset invariant plane and both rank-one reflection counterexamples.

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.deutsch_jozsa_general` adds the general Hadamard and XOR-ancilla circuit, promise separation, edge cases and one-qubit compatibility.

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.simon` adds the complex two-register Simon circuit, exact promised distribution and rank-conditional period recovery. See [Simon](../03_quantum_physics_and_optics/QuantumSimonsAlgorithm.md).

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.phase_estimation_general` adds general controlled-power QPE, unitary Fourier transforms, exact dyadic recovery and the nearest-sample 4/π² probability bound. A normalized eigenstate is supplied. [Scope and assumptions](../03_quantum_physics_and_optics/QuantumPhaseEstimationGeneral.md).

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.shor_order_finding` derives the padded modular-multiplication spectrum and the QPE marginal on |1⟩. The component bound is 4/π²; its guaranteed contribution to the mixture is 4/(rπ²). Order recovery and factorization are not claimed. [Scope and assumptions](../03_quantum_physics_and_optics/QuantumShorOrderFindingCore.md).

`DistributedSystemsFullSuite.suzuki_kasami` proves reachable token conservation and mutual exclusion. Eventual service requires ReliableDelivery, WeakFairness and FiniteCS. A reachable counterexample refutes LN ≤ RN at the holder. [Scope and serialization](../09_distributed_systems/DistributedSuzukiKasamiMutex.md).

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.shor_continued_fractions` proves finite executable candidates and conditional recovery under the strict Legendre bound. Euclidean stages are bounded separately from bit complexity. [Scope and assumptions](../03_quantum_physics_and_optics/QuantumShorContinuedFractions.md).

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.shor_order_recovery` proves conditional recovery from certified divisors, the spectral GCD criterion and a counterexample to taking all candidate denominators. [Scope and assumptions](../03_quantum_physics_and_optics/QuantumShorOrderRecoveryGCD.md).

`DistributedSystemsFullSuite.raymond_tree` includes reachable token conservation, effective holder routing, conditional starvation freedom and exact isolated traffic. [Contract](../09_distributed_systems/DistributedRaymondTreeMutex.md).

`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.naimark` adds finite POVM dilation, Born-trace preservation, a unitary extension with a fixed pure ancilla and Lueders reduction. POVM effects do not uniquely specify state updates. [Contract](../03_quantum_physics_and_optics/QuantumPOVMNaimarkDilation.md).

The `QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.no_cloning_unitary` field includes the exact unitary
no-cloning suite, with phase-invariant density overlap constraints and BB84 obstruction.

`DistributedSystemsFullSuite.coordinated_attack` adds finite-horizon coordinated
attack impossibility, with delivery-removal indistinguishability derived from
local transitions. Agreement and ValidityZero force retreat, contradicting
ReliableSuccess. [Contract](../09_distributed_systems/DistributedCoordinatedAttackImpossibility.md).

`CryptoFullSuite.musig_group` adds finite cyclic-group Schnorr aggregation,
composition of accepted partial responses and a naive rogue-key witness.
[Contract](../04_cryptography/CryptoSchnorrMultiSignaturesMuSigGroup.md).

Module 191 adds `QuantumQutritDecoderCircuitRefinement.verification_suite` through
`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.qutrit_circuit_refinement`; see the
[beta 0.7 release](../../docs/release-v0.7.0.en.md).

`DistributedSystemsFullSuite.tendermint_slashing` connects certified offender
attribution to exact rational slashing and conditional honest-share growth.
[Contract](../02_distributed_systems/DistributedTendermintSlashingPenaltyContract.md).

Module 197 adds `DistributedSystemsFullSuite.epoch_quorum`: weighted honest quorum intersection across epochs, with strict and non-strict threshold conventions.

Module 198 adds `DistributedSystemsFullSuite.lock_handover`: checked adoption, conditional round-zero agreement and justified finite local lock replacements.

Module 199 adds `DistributedSystemsFullSuite.handover_induction`: conditional all-round agreement and registered local execution refinement.

Release v0.7.9 registers `DistributedSystemsFullSuite.epoch_transition_master`,
`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.hctk_scalar`, and `DistributedSystemsFullSuite.header_chain_auth`.
Their conditional formal scopes are described in the new module cards.

Release v0.7.10 adds `CryptoFullSuite.ipa_forking` and preserves the refined
`QuantumPhysicsFullSuite.hctk_scalar` contract. The new finite acquisition
result retains response availability and cryptographic security as external obligations.

Release v0.7.11 adds `CryptoFullSuite.ipa_probability`: finite distinct-square
fork probabilities and heavy-prefix bounds, with explicit valid-child premises
for extractor composition. General forking and ROM security remain open.

Release v0.7.12 adds `CryptoFullSuite.ipa_tree_probability` and
`CryptoFullSuite.ipa_bounded_retry`: complete-tree conditional probability,
first-success extraction and finite expected attempt count. No ROM/PPT claim.

Release v0.7.13 adds `CryptoFullSuite.ipa_product_tapes` and
`CryptoFullSuite.ipa_recursive_generator`: concrete independent retry tapes,
recursive checked child generation and finite conditional tree probability.
Source availability, ROM and runtime claims remain outside the proved guarantees.

Release v0.7.14 adds `CryptoFullSuite.ipa_node_retry`: independent local retries
at every recursive IPA node, exact finite probabilities and conditional lower
bounds. Strict actual amplification requires an actual attempt rate in (0,1).

Release v0.7.15 adds `CryptoFullSuite.ipa_partial_cache`: fixed-fork partial-cache
context safety, scheduled child-call dominance and independent exact probabilities.

Release v0.7.16 adds `CryptoFullSuite.ipa_public_scalar`: two supplied outer trees
bind dot(a,b)=c or yield an explicit original-generator relation; obtaining the pair remains external.

Release v0.7.17 adds `CryptoFullSuite.ipa_pedersen_consistency`: a supplied
Pedersen fork and two IPA trees are checked at one extracted scalar, yielding
a joint witness or an extended-generator relation. No single-transcript hidden-c
verifier or full ZK is claimed.

Release v0.7.18 adds `CryptoFullSuite.hidden_scalar_protocol`: full-vector
interactive hidden-inner-product verification, three-point witness-or-relation
extraction, and exact honest-verifier simulation under bijective blinding.
IPA compression, adversarial fork acquisition, ROM and PPT remain outside scope.

Release v0.7.19 adds `CryptoFullSuite.hidden_scalar_compression`: complete
single-path IPA compression, causal independent execution, exact HVZK under
bijective blinding, and witness-or-relation extraction from six supplied trees.
Adversarial fork acquisition, ROM and polynomial-time guarantees remain open.

Release v0.7.20 adds `CryptoFullSuite.fork_acquisition`: snapshot-indexed nested
acquisition with model-relative provenance and witness-or-relation extraction.
Exact Q/R costs apply to Clean runs; arbitrary runs retain actual logs and schedule
bounds. Conditional probability premises remain explicit; no ROM or PPT claim.

Release v0.7.21 adds `CryptoFullSuite.fork_progress`: conditional quota probability
bounds for retained branches, including retries, with direct snapshot adapters
and provenance/extraction composition. No independence or global-density inference.
